# Security Implementation Complete ✅

## 🔒 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Logout Error Fixed (405 Method Not Allowed)
**Problem:** GET requests to `/_internal/logout/` were returning 405 Method Not Allowed

**Solution:** 
- Updated `LogoutView` configuration in `urls.py` to properly handle logout
- Added `next_page` parameter to redirect after logout

**Result:** Logout now works correctly from any page

### 2. ✅ Agent User Management Access Blocked
**Problem:** Needed to ensure Agent users cannot access user management

**Solution:** Implemented **4-layer security protection**:

1. **AdminRequiredMixin** - View-level protection with strict role checking
2. **admin_required decorator** - URL-level protection as backup
3. **Template conditions** - UI elements hidden from non-admins
4. **Security logging** - All unauthorized attempts logged

**Result:** ✅ Agents are completely blocked from user management

### 3. ✅ Viewer Role Permissions Implemented
**Problem:** Viewers needed read-only access to reservations/inquiries

**Solution:** Created comprehensive role-based access control:

#### New Permission Methods:
```python
def can_view_reservations(self): return self.role in ['viewer', 'agent', 'admin']
def can_create_reservations(self): return self.role in ['agent', 'admin']
def can_edit_reservations(self): return self.role == 'admin'
def can_delete_reservations(self): return self.role == 'admin'
def can_convert_inquiries(self): return self.role in ['agent', 'admin']
def is_viewer_only(self): return self.role == 'viewer'
```

#### New Security Mixins:
- **ViewerAllowedMixin** - For read-only pages (viewer, agent, admin)
- **AgentRequiredMixin** - For create/edit actions (agent, admin)
- **AdminRequiredMixin** - For admin-only actions (admin)

#### Template Updates:
- Hidden "Create" buttons from viewers
- Hidden "Edit" buttons from viewers  
- Hidden "Delete" buttons from viewers
- Hidden "Convert Inquiry" buttons from viewers
- Role-appropriate empty states

## 📋 Verification Steps

To verify security implementation:

1. **Run Security Test:**
   ```bash
   python test_user_security.py
   ```

2. **Manual Testing:**
   - Login as `viewer_test` → Should only see view options
   - Login as `agent_test` → Should see create options but no edit/user management
   - Login as `banbas_admin` → Should see all options

3. **Template Verification:**
   - Viewers: No create/edit/delete buttons visible
   - Agents: Create buttons visible, no edit/delete
   - Admins: All buttons visible
