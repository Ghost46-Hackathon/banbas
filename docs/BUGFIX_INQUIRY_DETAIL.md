# Bug Fix: Missing Inquiry Detail Template

## Issue Description

**Error**: `TemplateDoesNotExist: backoffice/inquiry_detail.html`

**Occurred When**: Viewing individual inquiry details in the backoffice interface

**Root Cause**: The `ContactInquiryDetailView` was referencing a template that didn't exist in the codebase.

## The Problem

The view `ContactInquiryDetailView` in `backoffice/views.py` was configured to use:
```python
template_name = 'backoffice/inquiry_detail.html'
```

But this template file was missing from `templates/backoffice/`.

## The Solution

### 1. Created Missing Templates ✅

**Created `templates/backoffice/inquiry_detail.html`** with comprehensive features:
- **Inquiry Status Display**: Shows read/unread status with badges
- **Contact Information**: Name, email, phone with clickable links
- **Message Content**: Formatted message display with line breaks
- **Action Buttons**: Mark as read, convert to reservation, reply via email, delete
- **Quick Stats Sidebar**: Inquiry ID, status, received time
- **Contact Summary**: All contact details in one place
- **Delete Functionality**: Modal confirmation with inquiry details

**Created `templates/backoffice/convert_inquiry.html`** for inquiry conversion:
- **Visual Conversion Flow**: Animated arrow showing inquiry → reservation
- **Original Inquiry Summary**: Shows source inquiry details
- **Full Reservation Form**: Complete form for creating reservations
- **Pre-filled Data**: Guest name and contact from inquiry
- **Conversion Tips**: Helpful guidance in sidebar
- **Original Message Display**: Shows full inquiry message for reference

### 2. Enhanced View Functionality ✅

**Updated `ContactInquiryDetailView`** to handle additional actions:
```python
def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    inquiry = self.get_object()
    
    # Handle mark as read action
    if 'mark_read' in request.POST:
        inquiry.is_read = True
        inquiry.save()
        messages.success(request, f'Inquiry from {inquiry.name} marked as read.')
        return redirect('backoffice:inquiry_detail', pk=inquiry.pk)
    
    # Handle delete action
    elif 'delete_inquiry' in request.POST:
        inquiry_name = inquiry.name
        inquiry_subject = inquiry.subject
        inquiry.delete()
        messages.success(request, f'Inquiry "{inquiry_subject}" from {inquiry_name} has been deleted.')
        return redirect('backoffice:inquiry_list')
```

**Updated `ConvertInquiryView`** to handle form submission:
- Processes reservation creation from inquiry data
- Links new reservation to original inquiry via `source_contact`
- Creates audit log entry tracking the conversion
- Automatically marks inquiry as read when processed
- Provides success/error messaging
