## Audit Logging

### What Gets Logged
The system creates a comprehensive audit log entry containing:

```json
{
    "reservation_id": 123,
    "guest_full_name": "John Doe",
    "company_name": "ABC Corp",
    "arrival_date": "2025-10-01",
    "departure_date": "2025-10-05",
    "nationality": "American",
    "room_category": "pond_view",
    "number_of_rooms": 2,
    "room_types": {"single": 1, "double": 1},
    "meal_plan": "bb",
    "total_adults": 2,
    "total_children": 1,
    "booked_by": "Agent Smith",
    "contact_number": "+1234567890",
    "payment_method": "cash",
    "payment_currency": "USD",
    "total_price": "299.99",
    "created_by": "admin",
    "created_at": "2025-09-30T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-09-30T10:30:00Z",
    "deleted_by": "manager",
    "deletion_timestamp": "2025-09-30T15:45:00Z",
    "nights": 4,
    "total_guests": 3
}
```

### Audit Log Details
- **Action**: `deleted`
- **User**: Who performed the deletion
- **Timestamp**: Exact time of deletion
- **Reservation ID**: Original reservation ID for reference
- **Guest Name**: Preserved for identification
- **Complete Data**: All original reservation data stored as JSON

## Management Commands

### View Deleted Reservations
```bash
# View deletions from last 30 days
python manage.py view_deleted_reservations

# View detailed information
python manage.py view_deleted_reservations --detailed

# View deletions from specific time period
python manage.py view_deleted_reservations --days 7

# Filter by user who deleted
python manage.py view_deleted_reservations --user admin

# Combine options
python manage.py view_deleted_reservations --days 90 --detailed --user manager
```

### Example Output
```

## Database Schema Changes

### ReservationAuditLog Model Updates
- **reservation**: Changed to `SET_NULL` to preserve logs after deletion
- **original_reservation_id**: New field to store original reservation ID
- **guest_name**: New field to preserve guest name for reference
- **Enhanced JSON storage**: Comprehensive original data preservation

### Migration Applied
- `0002_reservationauditlog_guest_name_and_more.py`
- Safely handles existing audit logs
- Preserves all historical data

## Security & Permissions

### Access Control
- **Any authenticated user** can delete reservations
- **Admin users** have additional edit permissions
- **All deletions** are logged regardless of user role

### Data Protection
- **Audit logs cannot be deleted** through the UI
- **Complete data preservation** in audit trail
- **Timestamp verification** for all actions
- **User accountability** for all deletions

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Always double-check** reservation details before deletion
2. **Use appropriate deletion context** (from detail page for complex cases)
3. **Review confirmation modal** carefully
4. **Verify success messages** after deletion

### For Administrators
1. **Regular audit log reviews** using management commands
2. **Monitor deletion patterns** for unusual activity
3. **Backup audit logs** as part of data protection strategy
4. **Train users** on proper deletion procedures

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created
- `backoffice/views.py` - Added `ReservationDeleteView`

### Error Handling
- **Model validation** prevents incomplete deletions
