# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**banbas** is a project in its early stages. The repository currently contains minimal structure with just a basic README.md file.

### Repository Information
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/Ghost46-Hackathon/banbas.git

- **Project Type**: To be determined as development progresses

## Architecture

The project architecture is not yet established. This section will be updated as the codebase develops and patterns emerge.

## Common Commands

### Git Operations
```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Push changes
git push origin main
```

### Development Workflow
Since the project is in early stages, standard development commands are not yet established. This section will be updated once build tools, testing frameworks, and development workflows are implemented.

## Notes for Future Development

- No build system is currently configured
- No package manager configuration detected
- No testing framework is set up
- No linting or formatting tools are configured

As the project evolves, this WARP.md file should be updated to include:
- Specific build and test commands
- Project architecture and component structure
- Development workflow and coding standards
- Deployment procedures
